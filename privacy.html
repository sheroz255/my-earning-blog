            <p>Our blogs contain "Smart Links" and external resources. While we verify every link at the time of publication, we do not have control over the content of third-party sites.

            <h2>5. Data Security Protocols</h2>
            <p>Your data's security is our top priority. We implement SSL encryption and regular security audits. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. We strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information but cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
