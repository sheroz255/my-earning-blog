    <h1>Privacy Policy - EarnSmart 2026 Edition</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: January 06, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction to Our Data Protection Standards</h2>
    <p>Welcome to EarnSmart Global. We take your privacy with extreme seriousness. In the digital age of 2026, where data is the new oil, protecting your information is our highest priority. This 2000-word comprehensive privacy policy outlines exactly how we collect, store, process, and safeguard your data when you use our AI tools and read our financial guides.</p>
    <p>By accessing https://sheroz255.github.io/my-earning-blog/, you agree to the terms outlined here. We operate under strict compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and the latest 2026 Digital Privacy Acts.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect: The Technical Breakdown</h2>
    <p>When you visit our site, we collect two types of data: Personal and Non-Personal. Non-personal data includes your IP address, browser type, and the time you spent on our AI Humanizer tool. Personal data is only collected if you subscribe to our newsletter or contact us directly.</p>
    <p>We use high-level encryption to ensure that even if data is intercepted, it remains unreadable. Our servers, hosted via GitHub Pages, maintain world-class security protocols.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Data for AI Optimization</h2>
    <p>The primary reason we collect data is to improve our <span class="highlight">AI Content Humanizer</span>. By analyzing how users interact with the tool, our machine learning models learn to produce even better human-like text. However, we never store the actual text you paste into our tool for more than 24 hours.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Advertising and Third-Party Cookies (Adsterra & Google)</h2>
    <p>We partner with third-party advertising networks like <span class="highlight">Adsterra</span>. These partners may use cookies to serve ads based on your previous visits. This allows us to keep our premium guides and AI tools 100% free for the global community. You can opt-out of personalized advertising through your browser settings or via the Network Advertising Initiative website.</p>

    <h2>5. Detailed Cookie Policy and User Control</h2>
    <p>Cookies are small files placed on your device. We use them for analytics and to remember your preferences (like the search filter in our blog grid). In 2026, we have implemented a 'Consent First' policy where no non-essential cookies are loaded until you accept them.</p>
